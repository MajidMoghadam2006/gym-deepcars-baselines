# Baselines for DeepCars

This is the registered version of DeepCars for the [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) [environments](https://github.com/openai/gym/tree/master/gym/envs). DeepCars is a simple highway traffic simulator for training Reinforcement Learning agents to perform the high-level decision making on self-driving cars.

Here we exploted the baselines framework to train the agent in DeepCars in order to perform the high-level decision making of a self-driving cars in a highway driving setup.
